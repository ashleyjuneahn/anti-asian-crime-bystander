# How to intervene as a bystander
## Project Abstract
After writing a piece for USA TODAY on my experience being an Asian bystander at the scene of an anti-Asian crime, I was inspired to write a news article with other parts of my interviews and information I collected on how to be an active bystander. I present the article using a digital-first approach with features like scrollytelling, an interactive map, and a reading progress bar.
