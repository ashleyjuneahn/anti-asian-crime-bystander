# How to Intervene as a Bystander
## Project Abstract
After writing a piece for USA TODAY on my experience being an Asian bystander at the scene of an anti-Asian crime, I was inspired to write a news article with other parts of interviews and data I collected on the rise in anti-Asian crimes and how to be an active bystander. I present the article using a digital-first approach with features like scrollytelling, an interactive map using Mapbox, and a reading progress bar. Implementing the Mapbox map was the most challenging part of this project, because I had to familiarize myself with the documentation, particularly when customizing markers.
