        The COVID-19 pandemic ushered in an onslaught of anti-Asian hate, with a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/hate-crimes-asians-rose-76-2020-amid-pandemic/story?id=80746198" target="_blank">
        76% increase in hate crimes</a> targeting Asian Americans in 2020 compared to 2019. In response, Asian Americans Advancing Justice (AAJC) teamed up with Right to Be to hold bystander intervention trainings,
        which has so far reached <a href='https://www.advancingjustice-aajc.org/press-release/advancing-justice-aajc-and-right-be-offer-bystander-intervention-training-asian' target="_blank">
         more than 100,000 people</a> as of May 2022.

        <br><br>
        AAJC and Right to Be hold three different trainings for the Asian American community and its allies: bystander intervention on the different ways
        to intervene, conflict de-escalation in the case of direct intervention, and how to respond to anti-Asian harassment as a victim. 
        <br><br>
        “There&#39;s a whole range of emotions [when witnessing harassment] and it&#39;s happening in that split second and sometimes we freeze and that&#39;s okay,
        but knowing yourself in that moment, what is available to you, there is an opportunity to look and assess,” Dax Valdes, a senior trainer for Right to Be, said.
        <br><br>
        After the <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/17/us/shooting-atlanta-acworth' target="_blank">Atlanta Spa Shootings</a> in March 2021 which killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women, demand for bystander intervention trainings spiked to about 3,000 
        attendees per session, which they hosted daily in April 2021, according to Marita Etcubañez, AAJC senior director of strategic initiatives and bystander intervention trainer.

        The bystander intervention training begins with an overview of the history of racism toward Asian Americans such as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882
        and Japanese internment camps during World War II. It then reviews different types of disrespect toward Asian Americans, from microaggressions
        to physical attacks, and the different strategies bystanders can use to combat them.
        <br><br>
        Concerns of safety is one of the most common fears voiced among attendees at trainings, Etcubañez said. It is important to assess the situation
        and determine which intervention strategy to use so as to not jeapordize one's own safety. 
        <br><br>
        “You still feel scared and you still feel unsure, but there is always something you would be able to do," Valdes said. "
        We just need to bring your awareness to it, even if it is just asking, "Are you okay?" or taking a picture.”
        <br><br>
        The five strategies, known as the 5 Ds, are distract, delegate, document, delay, and direct. The training ends with hypothetical scenarios for people to
        practice which strategy they would use.

                      Engage the person who is being harassed by asking them for directions, or
                      accidentally drop or spill something.

                      Ask someone nearby for help and work together to create a plan to intervene. If possible,
                      look for a person with authority in the space, like a store supervisor.

                      “In those moments when you don&#8217;t feel comfortable using your voice, tell others what you need them to do,
                      because not everyone will have gone through these trainings," Valdes said.

                    <p> <b>Document:</b> <br><br>
                      Record or take notes of the harassment while keeping a safe distance. Always ask the person
                      who was harassed what they want to do with the documentation. Do not post without their permission.
                      <br><br>

                      “If you did document, share it with the people who were experiencing the harassment so that they&#8217;re able
                      to decide what to do with it, because that is part of the healing process: having control of your story and 
                      how you share your experience," Valdes said.

                      Many incidents of harassments happen very quickly, so even if you cannot intervene, you can still speak to them after
                      the incident. Ask if they are okay and what you can do to support them. Offer to accompany them to their next destination.

                      “Maybe you&#8217;re afraid to intervene and that is perfectly legitimate, but there are still things you can do afterwards to
                      take care of the people that faced harassment," Etcubañez said.

                      If you are physically safe and think it is unlikely the situation will escalate, you can choose to intervene directly by
                      saying, "Leave them alone," or "Please stop right now." Keep it short and succinct, and do not engage in an argument.
                      <br><br>

                      <br><br>
                      “The one wrong thing you can do is respond to harassment and hate with more harassment and hate," Etcubañez said.
                      "Don&#8217;t get into a back and forth. Describe the behavior that is unacceptable and tell them what you want them to do.
                      You should not match the tone and language of the harasser.”

        Despite a massive increase in anti-Asian hate crimes since the onset of the pandemic, Asian Americans remain the least likely minority group
        to be comfortable reporting a hate crime.
        <br><br>
        The Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism reported a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-339-percent-nationwide-last-year-repo-rcna14282" target="_blank">
        339% increase in hate crimes</a> targeting Asian Americans in 2021 compared to 2020. Yet, Asian Americans are among the least likely of minority groups to say they are “very comfortable” reporting a hate crime, according to an
        <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/curiosity/aapi-data-2021-discrimination/" target="_blank">AAPI Data 2021 survey</a>. 45% of Black Americans and 42% of Latino Americans said they are “very comfortable” reporting a hate crime, while only
        30% of Asian Americans and 36% of Pacific Islanders responded the same.
        <br><br>   
        Etcubañez pointed out that <a href='https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2013/02/07/chapter-2-demographic-portrait-of-adult-children-of-immigrants/#:~:text=Among%20all%20Asian%20Americans%2C%20both,dates%20back%20to%20the%201960s.' target="_blank">
        more than 90%</a> of the Asian American community are immigrants or children of immigrants, many of whom face barriers when reporting an incident.
        <br><br>
        “Especially for our first-generation immigrants, they don&#8217;t know the system here. They might come from countries where you don&#8217;t trust the government to do anything
        to protect you. There are language barriers,” she said. “Or sadly, I think a lot of people tend to think their experiences are not important enough to merit being reported.”
        <br><br>
        Valdes added that, “Don&#8217;t make waves. Keep your head down,” are part of Asian cultures that need to change in order to mobilize more of the community 
        and prevent more hate crimes.
        <br><br>
        He feels hopeful that the younger generation is speaking out in more numbers with the help of social media.
        <br><br>
        “Social media kind of eliminates those barriers [against] our parents and grandparents, so the next generation is not going to be as likely
        to be quiet, because someone can take out their phone, talk about their experience on their social afterward, and then start the conversation among other
        peer groups and hopefully it is a generative conversation," Valdes said.
